This portfolio website is developed by Aung Than Lwin. I'm a software engineer. I work across different technologies on Microsoft Platform including web development, windows, and mobile development. Currently my main area is in ASP.Net web development with both C# and VB.Net using Microsoft SQL Server as a backend database system. I'm a full stack developer as I also work on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and other front-end frameworks.

This website is developed by using Github Pages technologies from Microsoft,HTML, and Jekyll Static Page.
