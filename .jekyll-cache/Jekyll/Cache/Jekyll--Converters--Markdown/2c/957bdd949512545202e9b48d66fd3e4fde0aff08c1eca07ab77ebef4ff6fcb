I"ë<p>We are already experiencing some heat of May. Due to the covid-19 I think most people are staying home.
Parkings in front of my apartment are almost full these days. I did some grocery-shopping yesterday and found most of the people wear a facemask. For me, I not only wear a mask, I wear gloves also so that I can reduce contact with virus as much as possible. There are still people who doesnâ€™t wear mask properly or some who doesnâ€™t wear mask at all. That is not good. As not all store enforce the wearing of mask before entering their compound, some still neglects the health safety measure.</p>
