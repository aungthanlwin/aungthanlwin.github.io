<p>My first job working with an English Speaking Company owner, a Singaporean as well as a project manager for the projects. I had a great experience and also cheerful working colleagues from my country and from other countries. Company offered me to work in Singapore and since then I have been spending most of my time out of my country.At first, it was not so easy for me to communicate in English as it had never been a medium of my communication but my personal interest in English language helped me to some extent. I worked mainly with Microsoft Technologies focusing on application development and deployment across different domains like Accounting, HR and Document Management Systems.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wintheingieng.com">WT Engineering Pte Ltd (2007 - 2010)</a> <strong><span style="color: green;">Software Engineer</span></strong></p>

<p>I joined this Engineering Companyâ€™s IT Department as aÂ  junior software developer to maintain and enhance an existing sales and distribution control system. I also implemented new modules and features for the system.Â  During the time, the popularity was mainly on windows based applications. I got friendly manager, co-workers and working environment and some of them were my class mates in the university.Â  We got a chance to use full time ready internet to help implementing software and improving our skills which really was great. We went trips to other parts of the country to support customers in training new software. Short terms projects were more successful and fruitful during the time and there were nightmares of countryâ€™s electricity shortage that effected projects.</p>

<p>I spent four years in the university and I didnâ€™t really know well that it was worth spending time in a university. During the year I studied Computer Science in UCSY, I emphasized more on my particular interests. As a result, I got personal interest in programming and made friends with like-minded classmates who later helped a lot in my career ahead and may be I helped them too. I was able to make interest groups about programming and of course about other interesting stuffs as well. And those friendship I made has been going on till today. Honestly, I expected university education to be much better than I really achieved and I wanted a more free and interactive teaching system in Myanmar (Burma). As a result, I took hands on training from external training center like â€˜ACEâ€™, a popular IT training center at the time and I was more than ready to work as soon as I graduated from the university.</p>
