I"_<p>We are already experiencing some heat of May. Due to the covid-19 I think most people are staying home.
Parkings in front of my apartment are almost full these days. I did some grocery-shopping yesterday and found most of the people wear a facemask. For me, I not only wear a mask, I wear gloves also so that I can reduce contact with virus as much as possible. There are still people who doesn’t wear mask properly or some who doesn’t wear mask at all. That is not good. As not all store enforce the wearing of mask before entering their compound, some still neglects the health safety measure.</p>
